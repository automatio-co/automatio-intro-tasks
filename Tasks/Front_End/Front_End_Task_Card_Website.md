# Front End Task: Responsive Landing page

You can submit the solution in any of the following ways:

- A private repo (add `taher@vanila.io` as collaborator)
- A deployed version
- A public blog describing the process
- A small video of browser

---

Create a react/next.js/gatsby website similar to [this small card website](https://38b732f972d36118.demo.carrd.co/), you need to create just the front page. 

It should have,

- Valid HTML and CSS code.
- Clean code and folder structure.
- Responsive design.

Rules:

- You can use any photo from any unsplash or freepik. Use the right credits in the code.
- Avoid checking their source code.
- You can use any framework for responsiveness, vanila css preferred.
- This is only for testing purpose and you probably shouldn't use this in your public portfolio.
