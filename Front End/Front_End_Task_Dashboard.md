You can submit the solution in any of the following ways:

- A private or public repo
- A deployed version
- A public blog describing the process
- A small video of browser
----------

Create a react dashboard with **ant design/ant design pro**, it should have,

- Mock Login/Logout with LocalStorage
- A side panel with navigation.
- One of the page will have a table which will load a 100k rows CSV data with either infinity scrolling or pagination.

For the CSV data. It should be created from JSON data. Use a **sample json** from any public endpoint or create a fake backend yourself.

Here is a sample json data,

    [{
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 1,
      "title": "delectus aut autem",
      "completed": false
    },{
      "userId": 3,
      "id": 3,
      "title": "delectus aut autem"
    },{
      "userId": 1,
      "id": 56,
      "completed": false
    }]
