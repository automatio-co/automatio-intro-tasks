# Front End Task: Partial Data Extraction

You can submit the solution in any of the following ways:

- A private or public repo
- GitHub gist
- A public blog describing the process
- A deployed version
- A small video of browser console

---

We have setup a simple demo page ([click here](https://entrptaher.github.io/playground-partial-extraction/) to open).

Your task will be to write a function called **extractData()** to extract the title and subtitle from the blue boxes into an array.

There are two main noticeable points:

- Each box is randomly generated, sometimes it has title (class **.title**), sometimes subtitle (class **.subtitle**).
- Each box might have different tag, ie: span, section, div, article.

Regardless of the format,

- We need to extract the data using **document.querySelector** or some other way. You are free to use any library or tool.
- It should work with slight or no change if I change the selectors and the text inside title/subtitle, or the order of them.
- You cannot grab the data from the script tag. That is for demo purpose only.
- We should be able to run your code on the browsers console and see the result in the array like below.

Hereâ€™s how I did it for demo purpose.

You can share me the code in a GitHub gist or any code sharing site, write a blog about it, or show a small video. All I need to know about your DOM related skills. ðŸ˜„

Good Luck!
